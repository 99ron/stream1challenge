# User Centric Frontend Milestone

Overview:

With this project I've stuck with using the template files supplied regarding a band "The Monkees". Mentor has set a challenge to try and avoid using bootstrap and use flexbox
and/or other methods to set the stucture out for my website. I've gone for a simplistic design as I had mobile users in mind, I've created 5 pages which include; Index (main), Music, Events,
Band and Contact us. 
 
## UX

I started this project knowing that the website was for a band who want to get better exposure out on the wider web! With this in mind the website needed to feature space for sample tracks, video's,
band info, event line ups and most importantly a way for general public to be able to contact them for hiring. I started out with paper to draw my ideas which I then used a program called 'Pencil' to mock up
a digital version which could be sent so they have an idea of what I was planning to do (documents included). With all this in mind, as a user you can easily and quickly navigate around the site with
no issues.

### User Stories

- I'd like to listen to some music, I click on Music tab and click on play, this will play a track hosted on the site.
- I'd like to view their line up to see where they're playing next, click on the Events tab and look down the Events table, can see where they're playing and purchase tickets.
- I'd like to know who's in the band, click on the Band Tab and scroll down, this will show the band members with an image and description.
- I'd like to book them for an event, click on the contact us page and send a message, this will allow people to contact the band for queries.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Main Page: When you arrive to the site you're greeted with a vivid background which has an opaque layer over the top, this has quotes as well as a video implemented half way down the page.
Music Page: This page has a solid background colour, music is in a list where a user can hit play and listen without any issues. If they want to purchase any tracks or albums they can do so by 
            clicking on the image directly below the text.
Events Page: This page implements a table to layout the Date, Location and place to purchase tickets via an external source.
Contact Page: This utilises a form with ID's linking the label to the text fields, all having the 'required' tag so each box needs to be filled including @ on email which once done will
              use javascript to send a simple alert saying the message has sent.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
